# Software Engineering 2016.1 (M.Sc UPE)
**Professor**: [João Pimentel](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~jhcp)

**Classes**: Friday, 7h10 to 10h30, at i5.

**Post-graduation programme**: [ECOMP/POLI/UPE](http://mestrado.ecomp.poli.br/)


## Requirements
This is a Master's course on software engineering for students in this field, thus it is expected that the students are already familiar with its **processes and disciplines**. The recommended book for these requirements is:

>Engenharia de Software - Uma Abordagem Profissional. Roger S. Pressman (available at the library).

It is also expected that the students are able to program, code, implement, using **imperative programming**. They are not expected to know any particular algorithm, but to be able to implement any algorithm that is described to them based on object-oriented principles. A good textbook on the subject is:

> Programming Logic and Design, Comprehensive. Joyce Farrel.

Lastly... reading and listening skills on english.
